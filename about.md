**#CryptoSumiE** is an **ON-GOING** project.

It is deeply inspired by the crypto community, where trading is all about emotion.
The collection starts during the 2022 bear market, and aims to bring some zen vibes to chart candles lovers.

With a very simple aestetic, Crypto-Sumi-E use a basic color palette, in the respect of the japanese sumi-e painting movement.

Ink is more or less black (watered), supported by notes of deep red. 

All pieces are individually painted with zen attitude.

## Where can I buy a piece from the collection?

You can find all listed and available pieces on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-sumi-e)

## How many pieces the collection counts?

The final amount of sumi-e pieces are not yet defined. 
They will be released with successul waves.

## When will be the next drop?

To be informed about the next drop waves, please consider follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter/rootshe11) and join the project [Discord server](https://discord.io)

## Why should I collect one of these NFTs?

Mainly because you like the art, or you want to support my work as a CT artist. 
I do not promise anything else. Just enjoy and vibe.
